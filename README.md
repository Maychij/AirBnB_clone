# The AirBnB Clone Project
0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Project Description
This repository marks the initial phase of a collaborative project aimed at constructing a replica of the AirBnB website. In this preliminary stage, a console is been developed to oversee program data. The console will enable users to generate, modify, and delete objects, along with handling file storage. Through a mechanism of JSON serialization/deserialization, the storage ensures persistence across different sessions.

## The command interpreter:
The command interpreter functions through single-line commands. The application is a restricted set of accepted commands specifically tailored for the operation of the AirBnB website clone
